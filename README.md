## <a id="basic-integration" />Basic integration
We will describe the steps to integrate the FuturaeKit SDK into your Android project. We are going to assume that you are using Android Studio for your development.

### <a id="get-futuraekit-sdk-for-android" />Get FuturaeKit SDK for Android
You can download the latest SDK from the [releases](https://git.futurae.com/futurae-public/futurae-android-sdk/tags), or clone this repository directly.
This repository also contains a simple demo app to show how the SDK can be integrated.


### <a id="add-sdk-to-project" />Add SDK to Project
To integrate the FuturaeKit SDK into your project, copy `futuraekit.aar` into the `src/main/libs` folder of your app.
Then, in your modules `build.gradle` (the one under "app"), add the following dependencies:
```
compile 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.3.0'
compile 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-moshi:2.3.0'
compile 'com.squareup.moshi:moshi-adapters:1.4.0'
implementation 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.8.0'
compile 'com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor:3.8.0'
compile(name:'futuraekit', ext:'aar')
```

![][gradle-app]

And in the projects `build.gradle` adjust the repositories to include the `libs` folder:
```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
        flatDir {
            dirs 'src/main/libs'
        }
    }
}
```

![][gradle-project]


### <a id="add-permissions" />Add permissions
Please add the following permissions, which the FuturaeKit SDK needs, if they are not already present in your AndroidManifest.xml file:

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />

<meta-data
        android:name="com.google.android.gms.vision.DEPENDENCIES"
        android:value="barcode"/>
```


### <a id="basic-setup" />Basic setup
We recommend using an android [Application][android_application] class to initialize the SDK. If you already have one in your app already, follow these steps:

Firstly, in your `Application` class find or create the `onCreate` method and add the following code to initialize the FuturaeKit SDK:

```java
import com.futurae.sdk.FuturaeClient;

public class AppMain extends Application {

    // overrides
    @Override
    public final void onCreate() {

        super.onCreate();

        FuturaeClient.launch(this);
    }
}
```


Secondly, in your `res/values` folder make sure to create a file `futurae.xml` with the following contents:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>

    <string name="ftr_api_key">{FuturaeApiKey}</string>
    <string name="ftr_push_gcm_sender_id">{GcmSenderId}</string>
    <string name="ftr_base_url">https://api.futurae.com:443</string>

</resources>
```

![][config-xml]

**Note**: Initializing the FuturaeKit SDK like this is `very important`. Replace `{FuturaeApiKey}` with your SDK API key (in case you do not have one yet, use the following placeholder key: `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`),
and `{GoogleApiProjectNumber}` with the project number of the Google API you have set up for the GCM (see the [GCM Token Registration](#gcm-token-registration) section for more information).

### <a id="build-your-app" />Build your app

Build and run your app. If the build succeeds, you should carefully read the SDK logs in the console.

## <a id="features" />Features
### <a id="callbacks" />Callbacks
The SDK methods that perform API calls use callbacks as the feedback mechanism. These calls expect an object of the `FuturaeCallback` interface as an argument:
```java
public interface FuturaeCallback {
    void success();
    void failure(Throwable throwable);
}
```

### <a id="uri-schemes" />URI Schemes
The SDK is able to handle URI scheme calls, which can be used to either **enroll** or **authenticate** users.
Once your activity has been set up to handle the URI scheme call intents, get the intent data in the `onCreate()` method of your activity, which contains the URI that should be passed in the SDK, using the `handleUri()` method:

```java
FuturaeClient.sharedClient().handleUri(uriString, new FuturaeCallback() {
	@Override
	public void success() {

	}

	@Override
	public void failure(Throwable throwable) {

	}
});
```

### <a id="push-notifications" />Push Notifications
Your app must be set up to receive GCM push notifications from our server. You can choose to receive and handle these notifications yourself, or alternatively you can use the existing infrastructure provided in the SDK. You can find more information on how to setup GCM push notifications for your app in the [Google Cloud Messaging Developer Guide](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/android/client).

In order to be able to receive GCM notifications, you need to specify the following components inside the application section of your Manifest:

The GCM Receiver:
```xml
<receiver
  android:name="com.google.android.gms.gcm.GcmReceiver"
  android:exported="true"
  android:permission="com.google.android.c2dm.permission.SEND">
  <intent-filter>
    <action android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.intent.REGISTRATION"/>
    <action android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE"/>

    <category android:name="${applicationId}"/>
  </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

The Instance ID listener service and Registration intent service (the ones provided in the SDK, or your own):
```xml
<service
  android:name="com.futurae.sdk.gcm.FTRInstanceIdListenerService"
  android:exported="false">
  <intent-filter>
    <action android:name="com.google.android.gms.iid.InstanceID"/>
  </intent-filter>
</service>

<service
  android:name="com.futurae.sdk.gcm.FTRRegistrationIntentService"
  android:exported="false"
  />
```

The GCM Listener service (the one provided in the SDK, or your own):
```xml
<service
  android:name="com.futurae.sdk.gcm.FTRGcmListenerService"
  android:exported="false">
  <intent-filter>
    <action android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE"/>
  </intent-filter>
</service>
```

#### <a id="gcm-token" />GCM Token Registration
The `FTRRegistrationIntentService` is responsible for registering the app's GCM token to the Futurae server. This is important for the server to be able to issue GCM notifications for your app. The provided service handles this, however if you need to, you can write your own or extend the existing one. The call that registers the GCM token to the Futurae server is `registerPushToken()`, and it is necessary every time the GCM token is generated or is changed by GCM.

For example, once the app receives a new GCM token (e.g. via an `InstanceIdListenerService`), the token needs to be obtained and registered to the Futurae server using the following code:
```java
FuturaeClient.sharedClient().registerPushToken(gcmToken, new FuturaeCallback() {
	@Override
	public void success() {

	}

	@Override
	public void failure(Throwable t) {

	}
});
```

#### <a id="gcm-listener" />GCM Listener Service
The `FTRGcmListenerService` receives GCM push notifications and handles them, according to the actions dictated by the Futurae server. You can use or extend the service provided by the SDK, or write your own. There are two distinct push notification types issued by the Futurae server: **Aprove** or **Unenroll**.

In case you want to process and handle the GCM notifications without using `FTRGcmListenerService`, you must use the following code in order to process and handle the notifications sent by the Futurae server, inside the implementation of your `GcmListenerService`:
```java
@Override
public void onMessageReceived(String from, Bundle data) {

	// Create and handle a Futurae notification
	FTRNotification notification = notificationFactory.createNotification(data);
	notification.handle();
}
```

#### <a id="local-intents" />Local Intents
Once a Futurae GCM notification has been handled, the SDK will notify the host app using **local broadcasts**. The app should register a broadcast receiver for these intents and react accordingly. There are three distinct Intents that the notification handlers might send in a local broadcast:
* `INTENT_GENERIC_NOTIFICATION_ERROR`: Indicates that an error was encountered during the processing or handling of a GCM notification.
* `INTENT_APPROVE_AUTH_MESSAGE`: Indicates that a Push Notification Authentication has been initiated.
* `INTENT_ACCOUNT_UNENROLL_MESSAGE`: Indicates that a user account has been logged out remotely.

The following example shows how to register for these intents:
```java
IntentFilter intentFilter = new IntentFilter();
intentFilter.addAction(Shared.INTENT_GENERIC_NOTIFICATION_ERROR);  // General notification error intent
intentFilter.addAction(Shared.INTENT_APPROVE_AUTH_MESSAGE);        // Approve Authentication notification intent
intentFilter.addAction(Shared.INTENT_ACCOUNT_UNENROLL_MESSAGE);    // Logout user notification intent

LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(getContext()).registerReceiver(new BroadcastReceiver() {

	@Override
	public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {

		switch(intent.getAction()) {
			case Shared.INTENT_ACCOUNT_UNENROLL_MESSAGE:
				// Handle unenroll notification (e.g. refresh lists)
				break;

			case Shared.INTENT_APPROVE_AUTH_MESSAGE:
				// Handle approve notification (e.g. show approve view)
				break;

			case Shared.INTENT_GENERIC_NOTIFICATION_ERROR:
				// Handle GCM notification error
				break;
		}
	}
}, intentFilter);
```

### <a id="enroll-user" />Enroll User

To enroll a user, you must call the `enroll()` method, using a valid code obtained by scanning an enrolment QR Code. For example, you can use a QR Code Reader Activity to scan a code and obtain the result:
```java
startActivityForResult(FTRQRCodeActivity.getIntent(this), FTRQRCodeActivity.RESULT_BARCODE);
```

If a QR Code is successfully scanned then `onActivityResult` will be called, with the scanned code:
```java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {

	if (resultCode == RESULT_OK && requestCode == FTRQRCodeActivity.RESULT_BARCODE) {
		Barcode qrcode = data.getParcelableExtra(FTRQRCodeActivity.PARAM_BARCODE);

		FuturaeClient.sharedClient().enroll(qrcode.rawValue, new FuturaeCallback() {
			@Override
			public void success() {

			}

			@Override
			public void failure(Throwable throwable) {

			}
		});
	}

}
```

Please make sure to call enroll, inside the onActivityResult method to complete the user enrollment.

### <a id="logout-user" />Logout User
To remove a user account from the app and the SDK, call the `logout()` method:
```java
FuturaeClient.sharedClient().logout(userId, new FuturaeCallback() {
	@Override
	public void success() {

	}

	@Override
	public void failure(Throwable throwable) {

	}
});
```

Typically this should happen either when the user removes the account manually from the app, or when a user has been logged out remotely by the server. In the former case, calling the `logout()` method is enough, as it notifies the server of the logout and deletes the account from the SDK too. In the latter case, the server will send a GCM notification to the app, and the default handler of the notification will delete the account from the SDK as well. In this case, the notification handler will also send a local broadcast to the app (see `INTENT_ACCOUNT_UNENROLL_MESSAGE` [above](#local-intents), so that the app can also perform any further action required (e.g. refresh the list of active accounts in an account view).

The intent contains the User ID as an extra:
```java
String userId = intent.getStringExtra(FTRUnenrollNotification.PARAM_USER_ID);
```

### <a id="account-status" />Account Status
To get a list of all enrolled accounts, call the following method:

```java
List<Account> accounts = FuturaeClient.sharedClient().getAccounts();
```

To fetch the status and current sessions for these accounts, you can use the following method (where `userIds` is a list of the corresponding user IDs):

```java
FuturaeClient.sharedClient().getAccountsStatus(userIds, new FuturaeResultCallback<AccountsStatus>() {
    @Override
    public void success(AccountsStatus accountsStatus) {
        // Handle the pending sessions
    }

    @Override
    public void failure(Throwable throwable) {
        // Handle the error
    }
});
```

**Hint:** You can use this method if you want to check if there are any pending sessions, e.g. when the app wakes up or the user refreshes the view.
For each account, a list of active sessions will be returned, and each session includes a `session ID` to proceed with the authentication.


### <a id="auth-user" />Authenticate User
To authenticate (or reject) a user session, depending on the authentication factor, you can use the following methods: **QR Code Factor**, or **Push Notification Factor**.

#### <a id="qrcode-auth" />QR Code Factor
To authenticate with the QR Code Factor, scan the QR Code provided by the server and pass its contents to the following method:
```java
FuturaeClient.sharedClient().approveAuth(qrCodeString, new FuturaeCallback() {
	@Override
	public void success() {

	}

	@Override
	public void failure(Throwable throwable) {

	}
});
```

#### <a id="approve-auth" />Push Notification Factor
When a Push Notification Factor session is initiated on the server side, the server will send a push notification to the app, where the user should approve or reject the authentication session. The notification is received and handled by the SDK, which in turn will send a local broadcast (see `INTENT_APPROVE_AUTH_MESSAGE` [above](#local-intents)), so that the app can perform any required actions. For example, the app might want to display a prompt to the user so that they can approve or reject the session.

The intent contains an object that describes the authentication session as an extra. This object contains the User ID and the Session ID, which are required for sending the authentication outcome to the server:
```java
ApproveSession authSession = intent.getParcelableExtra(FTRApproveNotification.PARAM_APPROVE_SESSION);
String userId = authSession.getUserId();
String sessionId = authSession.getSessionId();
```

Once the outcome of the authentication has been decided by the app, it should be sent to the server for the authentication session to complete.

##### <a id="approve-reply" />Approve Authentication
To approve the authentication session, use the following method:
```java
FuturaeClient.sharedClient().approveAuth(userId, sessionId, new FuturaeCallback() {
	@Override
	public void success() {

	}

	@Override
	public void failure(Throwable t) {

	}
});
```

##### <a id="reject-reply" />Reject Authentication
The user might choose to reject the authentication session. Additionally, in case the session has not been initiated by the user, they might also choose to report a fraudulent authentication attempt back to the server. In this case, use the following method:
```java
boolean reportFraud = false; // Set to true to report a fraudulent attempt
FuturaeClient.sharedClient().rejectAuth(userId, sessionId, reportFraud, new FuturaeCallback() {
	@Override
	public void success() {

	}

	@Override
	public void failure(Throwable t) {

	}
});
```

#### <a id="totp-auth" />TOTP Factor
The TOTP Factor can be used for offline authentication, as there is no requirement for an internet connection in the app. To get the current TOTP generated by the SDK for a specific user account, call the following method:
```java
CurrentTotp totp = FuturaeClient.sharedClient().nextTotp(userId);
String passcode = totp.passcode;            // The TOTP that the user should use to authenticate
int remainingSeconds = totp.remainingSecs;  // The remaining seconds of validity of this TOTP
```
As seen in this example, the `nextTotp()` method returns an object that contains the TOTP itself, but also the remaining seconds that this TOTP will be still valid for. After this time, a new TOTP must be obtained by the SDK.


#### <a id="session-information" />Session Information
For a given session, either identified via a `session ID` (e.g. received by a push notification) or a `session Token` (e.g. received by a QRCode scan), you can ask the server for more information about the session:

```java
// if you have a session ID
FuturaeClient.sharedClient().sessionInfoById(userId, sessionId, new FuturaeResultCallback<SessionInfo>() {
    @Override
    public void success(SessionInfo sessionInfo) {
        // Handle the session
    }

    @Override
    public void failure(Throwable throwable) {
        // Handle the error
    }
});

// if you have a session Token
FuturaeClient.sharedClient().sessionInfoById(userId, sessionId, new FuturaeResultCallback<SessionInfo>() {
    @Override
    public void success(SessionInfo sessionInfo) {
        // Handle the session
    }

    @Override
    public void failure(Throwable throwable) {
        // Handle the error
    }
});
```

If there is extra information to be displayed to the user, for example when confirming a transaction, this will be indicated with a list of key-value pairs in the `extra_info` part of the response.
